            "This week, I took some time to identify areas I would like to improve upon. I've noticed in many of the applications I've viewed during my job search that PHP and Backend work are very important skills to be proficient in as these seem to be highly desired. Given that I've mostly just worked on 2 projects with PHP, I want to have a grand understanding of Laravel, PHP, Databases and CRUD. I have decided to continue learning on these subjects by purchasing some online courses to further my development. ",
            "What has your job search experience been like?",
            "Locally, I haven't seen many employers looking for junior developers as much as I thought I would. It could be because of Covid-19 and the fact that many businesses are working hard to stat a float, or it could be that most employers want someone who is already highly experienced in the languages, frameworks and tools that they use. Even so, I apply and use these application experiences to my benefit to learn more about what is desired and how I can become a better programmer for it."

So for the first week of post Bootcamp, I took care of many of the things I neglected during Bootcamp. One of those being that I sent my Macbook to Apple for much needed repairs. While I enjoyed the downtime, I also spent some time watching coding interview videos and reading coding articles to keep my mind fresh. As week 2 of post Bootcamp is coming to a close, I've spent time looking over my final project to start making some changes for the next iteration. I've also applied for jobs and practiced writing cover letters.",

I believe my understanding is growing but I didn't checkoff 2 of my goals for the project this week. I took this weekend to go back and study vanilla JS in areas that I am still lacking. I haven't found the time to go back to things I didn't spend enough time on, so I made it priority #1 this weekend. I am still planning on doing more of that this week. As our front end time is coming to a close, I want to get more well versed to be ready for the final project in a few weeks.

Now, in week 5, my knowledge has grown but I am still staring into a glass, darkly. I have grown so much in the last 9 weeks. To think that I could publish a fully developed webpage at this point in Week 1 would have seemed an impossibility. Now it is a very exciting process but still very challenging.

Within that time frame you can learn  words, some phrases, maybe even a little bit of local lingo, but theres still work to be done to be proficient.

Walking through and implementing API's, JSON data (objects- values and properties) and Asynchronous JavaScript (fetch/promise, then/fulfillment, catch/error) will help me to become a stronger developer. I am looking forward to using the information I learned this week in my future projects.",
            "What does it mean to develop good code?",
            "This is a question I have asked myself every week of this course. What <em>does</em> it mean to develop good code? I think thats a question I'll continue to piece together as I grow. One thing I've learned over this week is that to develop good code, you have to develop good thinking. Critical, computational, logical thinking. All extremely important to developing good code. I think asking the right questions develops good code. Knowing when and how to ask questions continues to be a important part of the coding process.",
            " What does it mean to be a good developer?.",
            " All of the things that I mentioned to develop good code can be used to answer this question as well! I think speaking outside the box of being a good developer, being open to feedback, listening to other developers on your team, making an extra effort to step in and help by answering a question or offering to grab a cup of coffee for a friend knee-deep in code can be a big part of being a good developer. To me right now, growing as a developer I want to be better at identifying a problem faster, identifying the right steps to take as a process starts. I can't say it enough because I can't hear it enough, Pseudo Coding is so important. It is the foundation to be laid before the first piece of code should be written. I need to engrain that in my mind. "

I really can't think of anything that I disliked about HTML. Week 2 starting the journey in HTML and CSS was a challenge but also rewarding. I appreciated learning how to style elements to bring an HTML page to life. I am still learning my way around CSS so one thing I wasn't crazy about was how many details can go into one element and how hard it is to memorize all of the styles and weights to an style. I've got a ways to go in making a webpage from scratch beautiful but I am still very early in my journey. Weeks 3 and 4 of JavaScript were the hardest of Bootcamp so far for me as I got lost in all of the syntax. Functions, operators, loops, if/else statements, arrays, methods, variables, strings, booleans... you name it, I got confused about it! There was so much information that I tried to contain it all and I could only fit some much into my current 8gb mind! I'm looking forward to growing with JS and having it become a close friend. I feel as though I've come a good way in the last 2 weeks, but as I go into week 5, and week 1 of in house Bootcamp, I will have times that I am still confused and challenged, but I am also excited to learn from my instructors, with my classmates. I truly believe we will all bring out the best in each other!",

I found that when I would sit time aside to work on a specific task, as soon as I would sit down to begin working, something would happen that would require my attention. <br /> <br /> I also think that the wealth of material that has been made available to us was part of my hindrance. I found that my lack of unfamiliarity to certain projects was a lot at times. I would scour to find any information that would assist my cause, and at times it slowed me down. When I invest in something, I like doing research to make sure it is worthwhile. I has found out these last 4 weeks that it takes time to develop knowledge to do certain tasks, or learn ways to be DRY in my and make things simpler. I must take with me from this last month that it's ok to not be ok, and that in time things will become easier as my knowledge grows.",

Sure, a vanilla (HTML) cake tastes fine as is, but add a layer of chocolate (CSS) and it enhances your taste buds. However if you really want a full delicious experience, you can top is off with a layer strawberry and you get the full taste experience. I think thats how I'm learning a web page works.Sure HTML and HTML and CSS webpages can look great, but user experience ignites when JavaScript comes to play. Without it, our online shopping experiences wouldn't be the same, we'd have no Netflix to binge, and we wouldn't know when we've met our allotted characters when typing a tweet.This week I've really been relying on JavaScript notation, videos on JavaScript and better ways to understand its functionality.I've been working hard on trying to understand what is being asked of be, pseudo coding how to approach the problem,and then looking for the tools I need to complete the problem. This has been a struggle to me because I like to jump head first into a problem with basic information, when sometimes I need to take a step back and gather all of the puzzle pieces and come up with a plan of action.",
