            "Week 1 of 20 is in the books! I must say that Pre Work Week 1 had it's challenges. At times I was very frustrated at my lack of knowledge. As I was confronted with challenges and blockers, I looked to the information provided in the Trello board, as well as reaching out via the Slack Help channel. What a blessing that has been to my classmates and I.",
            "My biggest challenge was working through the command line. I wanted to start off week 1 strong and I knew focusing on command line would be priority #1 for me. As the week came to a close, I began to feel more confident in command line, but not confident enough to know I am not at a place where I can begin to feel comfortable. There is a lot of work to be done and I am excited to work!",
            "This week I learned how to create a local repository with files by way of the command line. It is so simple to right click on the desktop and create a folder, but I really enjoyed learning how to do it through the command line. I learned that the Command Line is bittersweet to a beginner. You can begin to see the beauty of what you can accomplish once you get past the blockers.  I also learned how to merge an existing project to a Github repository, and the importance of having a local and remote copy of your work."

            "I have come to realize that if you don't come into a project with a plan, if you try to piece things together as they go, you can get lost in a mess of code. One thing I enjoy about pseudo coding is that you have a game plan. You have an understanding of where you're trying to go. From there, you map out your destination. I am an \"on the fly\" guy, so I am going to have to wrangle myself in to being disciplined to keep to the pseudo code model. It saves headaches and time.",
            "I have struggled with files and folder in my blog. I created a folder inside of my blog folder to hold each of my weekly blog posts. I have not figured out why my directories are not lining up correctly. When I click the nav bar to take me home or to a weekly blog link, I get an error. This is very frustrating because I am waisting a lot of time on an issue that should be easily resolvable for an experienced programmer, but it is a mountain for this \"young in the tooth\" novice.",
            "I am excited to learn more about CSS this week. With JavaScript coming up as well, I want to get a firm grasp of the basics of CSS. I have some experience in JavaScript from a prior course, and I remember how challenging it is. I want to be on my toe going into the next weeks lessons and assignments to present a nice product from Pre Work Week 3 Demo Day."

            "When I was first introduced to the concept of a website built by HTML, CSS and Javascript, I was introduced to it as a 3 layer cake. Each layer providing crucial substance to a webpage. Sure, a vanilla (HTML) cake tastes fine as is, but add a layer of chocolate (CSS) and it enhances your taste buds. However if you really want a full delicious experience, you can top is off with a layer strawberry and you get the full taste experience. I think thats how I'm learning a web page works.Sure HTML and HTML and CSS webpages can look great, but user experience ignites when JavaScript comes to play. Without it, our online shopping experiences wouldn't be the same, we'd have no Netflix to binge, and we wouldn't know when we've met our allotted characters when typing a tweet.This week I've really been relying on JavaScript notation, videos on JavaScript and better ways to understand its functionality.I've been working hard on trying to understand what is being asked of be, pseudo coding how to approach the problem,and then looking for the tools I need to complete the problem. This has been a struggle to me because I like to jump head first into a problem with basic information, when sometimes I need to take a step back and gather all of the puzzle pieces and come up with a plan of action.",
            "I am sad that I haven't added any JavaScript to my blog at this point. I want to be diligent in running my own code when I add JS to my page, and at this point I haven't. I am hoping that Pre Work Week 4 will help me gain confidence and understanding in creating my own JS for my blog. I would like to add a comment section to my blog for others to leave advice or comments on my work thus far."
